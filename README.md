🚀 Responsive HTML Templates - Because Websites Shouldn't Look Like 90's MySpace
Welcome to the world of Responsive HTML Templates! 🎉

Are you tired of websites that look perfect on a 27-inch monitor but turn into chaos on your phone? 😱 Fear not! My collection of sleek, modern, and oh-so-responsive HTML templates has got you covered. From portfolio sites to full-on e-commerce magic, these templates adapt like a pro—just like your mom trying to understand TikTok.

Why Use These Templates? 🤔
Responsive AF: Works on all devices, whether it's a phone, tablet, or your smart fridge. (Okay, maybe not the fridge yet, but we’re working on it…)
Easy to Customize: Just like your coffee order—add a little code here, a little tweak there.
Modern Vibes: Say goodbye to sites that look like they were made in 1998. Unless you're into that, no judgment.
Free: Because who doesn’t love free stuff? 🎁
