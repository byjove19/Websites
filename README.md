# 🚀 Responsive HTML Templates – Backend Dev Approved  

Frontend is cool and all, but let’s be real—without a solid backend, it’s just a bunch of pretty divs floating in the void. That’s why I built these **lightweight, backend-friendly** HTML templates that integrate smoothly with any server-side stack.  

## Why These Templates?  
✅ **Backend-Ready** – No unnecessary bloat, just clean, structured HTML for seamless integration.  
✅ **Fully Responsive** – Works on all screens (except maybe your toaster).  
✅ **Easy to Customize** – Plug it into your API, tweak it with your templating engine, and go live.  
✅ **Modern & Clean** – No weird 90s layouts. We’ve evolved.  
✅ **Free & Open Source** – Because who doesn’t love free stuff?  

## How to Use  
1. Clone the repo like a pro.  
2. Pick a template and connect it to your backend (PHP, Node.js, Python, you name it).  
3. Serve it dynamically with EJS, Handlebars, Blade, or whatever makes your dev heart happy.  
4. Deploy it and enjoy smooth, responsive UI without the frontend headaches.  

## Tech Stack Compatibility  
💡 Works effortlessly with:  
- **Node.js & Express** – EJS, Pug, Handlebars? No problem.  
- **PHP & Laravel** – Drop it into Blade and call it a day.  
- **Django & Flask** – Jinja templates will love this.  
- **Go, Ruby, or Anything Else** – If it serves HTML, you're golden.
